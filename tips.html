                        Format documents to fix your indenting. It always gives you a bad indenting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use style. It is good to write a simple code but clean.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mouse but use keyboard shortcut instead.
                        <h3>
                            What keyboard shortcut should you use? 
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Those are the most important keyboard shortcut in html. It is always good to use them when you write a code.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>END</kbd> is used when you want to jump one word.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>FN</kbd> + <kbd>END</kbd> is used to jump to the end of the documents.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you want to edit a same text at the same time you need to select all then <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> untill you get all of the text you want to edit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When you want to fix the indenting using <kbd>TAB</kbd> is faster.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you don't want the writing in one row use <em>toggle word wrap</em>. By clicking <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> then choose toggle word wrap, it will automatically fix your writing in a new line when it is too long.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
