                <p>
                    There are some different html rules. I am inquisitive sharing some of them with you. Those are the most important you need to know when you code. 
                </p> 
            </header>
            <h2>
                The rules we need to know:
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you write a code, you need to use greater than and less than for the elements like this <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. We need right slash (/) after the less than (<) to end an element. For example: <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>...<code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. If you want to be good at code, the things you need to be careful about these two rules.

                <li>
                    <a href="nested-rules.html">Nested rules</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="attribute-rules.html">Attribute rules</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <footer>
                If you respect the rules of those two html, you have made a good code.
